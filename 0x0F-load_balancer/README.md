Here I continued to build up the configuration of the web server
issued in project 0x0B. I was issued two additional servers, one to replicate
the Nginx configuration of my original server, and another to set up an HAproxy
load balancer on to manage both web servers.

Here are the implementation specifications

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Double the number of webservers**
  * [0-custom_http_response_header](./0-custom_http_response_header): Bash
  script that installs and configures Nginx on a server with a custom HTTP
  response header.
    * The name of the HTTP header is `X-Served-By`.
    * The value of the HTTP header is the hostname of the server.

* **1. Install your load balancer**
  * [1-install_load_balancer](./1-install_load_balancer): Bash script that
  installs and configures HAproxy version 1.5 on a server.
    * Enables management via the init script.
    * Requests are distributed using a round-robin algorithm.

* **2-puppet custom http response header**
  * [2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp](./2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp): Bash script that
  Just as in task #0, weâ€™d like you to automate the task of creating a custom HTTP header response, but with Puppet.
    * The name of the custom HTTP header must be X-Served-By
    * The value of the custom HTTP header must be the hostname of the server Nginx is running on
